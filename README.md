# TheColdBox
The Cold Box application created by three students (Semester -3) using **Flutter and Machine Learning** aims to make a significant change in food wastage and cost reduction in the kitchen. As we all know, about 1/2th of the produce is thrown into the garbage due to a lack of surveillance in the context of fruits and vegetables at home. The app uses machine learning to scan the vegetables and fruits, proposing a date before which they are consumable, reminds the user to use the product before they are perishable. We used Flutter to create an easy and interactable user interfaces as our clients are from different age groups.
